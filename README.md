# TaxiAnalisis

This project was conducted as a data scientist for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company launching in Chicago. The primary objective was to inform the launch strategy by finding patterns in ride-share data, understanding passenger preferences, and analyzing the impact of external factors on trip metrics.
The analysis uses statistical testing and exploratory data visualization to provide evidence-based insights for operational planning and competitive positioning in the Chicago market.
